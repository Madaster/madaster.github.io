## What information is shown here?
After opening an account, you will go to the details page for the account. This page contains general information. There, you will see a summary of the data entered. Below that, there is a table that shows the degree of completion of the materials entered, as well as an overview of the active source files that have been uploaded to this building. At the bottom of this page, you see the users who can access the building, and the privileges that have been assigned to them. 

## How are the tabs organized?

## How can I move a building to another portfolio?
You can move a building to another portfolio by clicking on ‘Move building’ under the general tab. You will see a dropdown with available portfolios where to the building can be moved. Be aware: this can have influence on the permissions of the users who can access the building.

## How can I add users to a building?
Go to the ‘General’ tab and click ‘Add user’.
Enter the e-mail address of the user you would like to add. If the person you are adding is already registered by Madaster, they will have immediate access to the portfolio. If the person is not a registered user, they will receive an e-mail explaining how to register.
Select the role you would like to assign to the user and click ‘Save’. See the following section for more information on the different user roles.
The users that you add to a building, will only be able to access that particular building. They cannot view the other buildings within the portfolio. Would you rather grant a user access to all buildings in one portfolio? Then, you add the user to the portfolio, instead of to the building.

## How can I change the roles of users who have access to an account?
