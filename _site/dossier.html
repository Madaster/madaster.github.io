    <h2 id="what-information-is-shown-here">What information is shown here?</h2>
<p>This tab contains the files uploaded for the specific building or portfolio. Here, you can add new files and change the status of files. There are three different file types. Source files are IFC/Excel files (only available on Building level) that are used for the calculating results for the building. General documents contain all other files such as management and working documents,product documentation and certificates. Materials passports, representing a snapshot of the applied materials and products in the building at any given moment, are also stored in the ‘Dossier’.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-upload-a-new-file">How can I upload a new file?</h2>
<p>Click the ‘Add file’ button. A new screen is opened.
Select the file type you would like to upload. (for multiple upload you can hold Control and select more files) You can choose a source file (IFC or Excel) (only available on Building level), building information, or a management or working document. See the corresponding manual for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Uploading a source file:</strong> This can be either an IFC or Excel file. When you click ‘Upload’, the file is uploaded to the Madaster Platform. As soon as the data has been processed, click ‘Close’.  You should now see the results: the four circles indicate the degree of completion of the data. You can see the percentage of elements that has a NL-Sfb coding, also the percentage of elements that has a material attached. Next to that you can see the amount of matched materials and the percentage of base quantities. At the top of this page you can click on the ‘Enrich’ tab. There, you will find a list of missing elements that must still be linked to materials from the database. See the ‘How can I link missing elements?’ section for more information.</p>

<p><strong>General documents:</strong> In addition to source files, you can also upload other relevant files to the Madaster Platform (on building and portfolio level), such as PDF files or images certificates, etc. When you click ‘Upload’, the file is placed in the correct section of the page.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-link-missing-elements">How can I link missing elements?</h2>
<p>When you upload a source file (IFC or Excel), the results of the data will be displayed in the ‘Results’ tab. On this tab you see the completeness of the materials assigned and linked. To link missing elements you take the following steps:</p>

<p>Click the ‘Enrich’ tab. This tab contains all elements that are still to be linked.</p>

<p>In the enrichment overview (accessible via the ‘Dossier’ tab) a tree structure is shown, in which the building layers (categorization of Stewart Brand) are displayed at the main level followed by the number of linked elements and the total number of elements. If the number of linked elements is lower than the total number of elements, this indicates that there are non-linked elements that require manual action from the user. The tree structure has several sub-levels with the element as the lowest level.</p>

<p>Click the ‘Link’ button of the element you would like to link. A new screen appears. In this screen, you are presented with two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can link a missing element to an existing element.</li>
</ol>

<p>Type the name of the element you are looking for. By clicking the magnification glass icon, you can search an existing element in the (Madaster) database.
Select the required element by clicking on it.
Click ‘Link’. Now, the missing element is linked to the existing element.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the existing element is not available in the (Madaster) database, you can create a new product or material.</li>
</ol>

<p>Click ‘Create new material’ or ‘Create new product’, depending on the element you would like to add.
Enter the requested data.
Click ‘Create’. 
Now, the missing element is linked to the new material and the element is displayed in the ‘Materials’ or ‘Products list on this page. This information is now included in your database on the Madaster Platform.</p>

<p>Repeat these steps for each missing element, until all elements are linked to a material or product, and you have reached a maximum degree of completion.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-edit-an-element-that-has-already-been-mapped">How can I edit an element that has already been mapped?</h2>
<p>Follow these steps after you have opened the page with the results (by using the ‘view status’ button of the source file):</p>

<p>Click on the ‘Enrich’ tab.
Navigate to the mapped element.
Click the ‘Edit’ button behind the element you want to edit.
Click on the three dots at the end of the element you wish to edit. Here you have the options to unlink or relink the element.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-edit-or-activate-a-source-file-that-has-already-been-uploaded">How can I edit or activate a source file that has already been uploaded?</h2>
<p>Click the ‘View status’ button for the source file you would like to edit. The results are displayed on the new page that is opened.
Click the ‘Enrich’ tab. Here, you can edit existing materials or link missing elements. See the ‘How can I link missing elements?’ section for more information.
Click the ‘Process’ tab to change the status of the file. Click ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. 
Once these steps are completed you can quickly activate or deactivate a source file in the dossier tab by checking or unchecking the box ‘Active’.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-changemovedownload-or-delete-files-that-have-already-been-uploaded">How can I change/move/download or delete files that have already been uploaded?</h2>
<p>Click on the three dots next to the file to change/move/download or delete the file.
<strong>Caution when removing:</strong> you cannot undo this action. If you do not want to use the file for the results of the building, you can change the status to ‘Inactive’, without having to delete the file. See the ‘How can change the status from active to inactive?’ section for more information.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-status-active-yes--no-mean">What does the status ‘Active: Yes / No’ mean?</h2>
<p>For each uploaded file you can choose if this file should be active or inactive. An inactive file is not included in the results of the building and the materials passport, an active file is. By default, every file is assigned the Inactive status (shown as unchecked in the column ‘Active’) after the file has been uploaded, since all missing elements must be linked first. After you have validated and linked the data entered, you can change this status to active. From that moment, the file is included in the results for the building in question.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-change-the-status-of-a-file-from-inactive-to-active">How can I change the status of a file from ‘Inactive’ to ‘Active’?</h2>
<p>Click on the ‘View status’ button of the file you would like to change the status of.
Click on the ‘Process’ tab. Here, you can indicate if the file must be included in the building data.
Click ‘Yes’.
Click ‘Process file’. The file is now active, and the data is included in the results and the materials passport.
Once these steps are completed, you can quickly activate or deactivate a source file in the dossier tab by checking or unchecking the box ‘Active’.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-change-the-status-of-a-file-from-active-to-inactive">How can I change the status of a file from ‘Active’ to ‘Inactive’?</h2>
<p>Click on the ‘View status’ button for the file you would like to change the status of.
Click on the ‘Process’ tab. Here, you can indicate if the file is to be included in the building data.
Click ‘No’.
Click ‘Process file’. The file is now active, and the data is included in the results and the materials passport.
Once these steps are completed you can quickly activate or deactivate a source file in the dossier tab by checking or unchecking the box ‘Active’.</p>

<h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-materials-passport-pdf-files-i-created-at-an-earlier-stage">Where can I find the Materials Passport (PDF files) I created at an earlier stage?</h2>
<p>The materials passport that you created on the ‘General’ tab is saved on the ‘Dossier’ tab. At the bottom of this tab, you find the materials passports that were created at an earlier stage below the heading ‘Passports’. There, you can download the created material passports to your computer by clicking the three dots next to the file. The download will start immediately. When the download is finished, you can open the PDF file. If you do not want to download a materials passport to your computer, but just want to view the passport, click the three dots for more options.</p>

<p>When creating a material passport, an Excel file is also generated and placed in the dossier. This excel file shows the general building data, the totals of all elements and the specific elements in the different layers per tab. In this way, it is possible to analyzes the details of a building by means of filtering etc. by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-search-using-a-filter-or-tags">How can I search using a filter or tags?</h2>
<p>By entering a keyword in the search bar at the left top you can filter the results. You can also filter by clicking on one or more tags at the left bottom on the page.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-change-the-folder-personal-files-and-add-subfolders">How do I change the folder Personal files and add subfolders?</h2>
<p>You can change the structure of the Personal Files folder by clicking on the three dots next to the folder. You will be directed to the Administration tab. Here you can add/rename/move or delete folders. Files in a folder that you want to delete will be placed one level higher of the folder that will be removed.</p>
