    <h2 id="what-information-is-shown-here">What information is shown here?</h2>
<p>You will find here all portfolios created in this account. A portfolio can be seen as a specific collection of buildings. You can change the view of the portfolios by clicking on ‘View’ on the left.

<ul>
  <li>Click ‘Add portfolio’.</li>
  <li>Enter the name of the portfolio.</li>

<h2 id="how-can-i-delete-a-portfolio">How can I delete a portfolio?</h2>

Then, you must first delete all buildings from the portfolio, before you can delete the portfolio itself. See ‘How can I delete a building from a portfolio’ for more information on deleting buildings. Once you have deleted all buildings from the portfolio, you take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the name or picture of the portfolio you would like to open’.</li>
  <li>Scroll down and click ‘Customize portfolio’.</li>

<p>Every organisational user who is authorized to create a portfolio, can make as many portfolios as they like. There is no limit. An individual user can make a single portfolio, this portfolio is created directly during the registration for the platform.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-access-a-portfolio">Who can access a portfolio?</h2>
<p>The creator of a portfolio has access to the portfolio. This user is the account administrator. Additionally, this user can grant other users access to their portfolios. See the following section for more information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the name or picture of the portfolio to open it.</li>

  <li>Here, you will see an overview of the users who can access the portfolio.</li>
  <li>Click ‘Add user’.</li>
  <li>Enter the e-mail address of the user you would like to add. If the person you are adding is already registered by Madaster, they will have immediate access to the portfolio. If the person is not a registered user, they will receive an e-mail explaining how to register.</li>
  <li>Select the role you would like to assign to the user at ‘permissions’ and click ‘Save’. See the following section for more information on the different user roles.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="which-roles-can-be-assigned-to-users-of-the-madaster-platform">Which roles can be assigned to users of the Madaster Platform?</h2>
<p>Users of the Madaster Platform can be assigned three roles: administrator, manager, and reader. The following table lists the user privileges of each of the roles.</p>

<p>The account administrator, who is also the owner of the account, has all privileges. As an administrator, you control user access. This means you can add and delete users, as well as set user privileges.   Additionally, you can create portfolios, add buildings, materials and products to the database, export materials passports, upload files, etcetera. As an administrator, you cannot change your own user privileges.</p>

<p>The account administrator can grant manager privileges. As a manager, you can customize the portfolios and buildings you have been granted access to.
Additionally, users can be granted reader access. As a reader, you can view the portfolios and buildings you have been granted access to. A reader can also download materials passports.</p>

<p>Every user can add as many buildings to a portfolio as they like. There is no limit, as long as you do not exceed the floor space limit of your subscription. See the section on the various subscription types for more information.</p>
