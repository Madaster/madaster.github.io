## HOW DO I ADD A NEW PRODUCT?
There are two ways to add a new product:

- Under the tab 'Materials & Products' in the toolbar is the button 'Add product +'.

- It is also possible to add a new product during the enrichment process. You can enter this screen in the file (at building level) by clicking on the arrow icon behind a source file. Then you can go to the second tab 'Enrich'. Here you will see an overview of all elements from your source file. If the element is not yet linked, you can click on the 'link'-icon. A screen will appear with a heading 'Create new' and click on the 'Product' button below it. If the element is already linked, you can click on the three dots at the end of the line and then click on 'Link again'. The same screen as described above will appear.

Both options take you to the screen to add a new product. Then fill in all data about the product where fields marked with a * are mandatory fields. It is possible to enter the name and description in six languages. It is only mandatory to enter the name in the language selected within the platform. If no name and/or description is entered in the other languages, the name and/or description will be copied to the other languages. In the field 'Product type' you indicate whether it is a volume, surface, length or piece product (for example, a volume product can be a concrete beam and a piece product can be an air conditioner). Please note that the product type field cannot be changed once the product has been saved. Once you have filled in all the details at the bottom of the page, press the 'Save' button. The product will then be created in your own database and can now be found in the materials and products overview.

After this you will appear on the screen to further specify the data of the just added product. By going through the various tabs, you can fill in additional data; for example in the field of search criteria, product composition and financial information.


### SEARCH CRITERIA
After this you will appear on the screen to further specify the data of the just added product. By going through the various tabs, you can enter additional data. It is essential that (good) search criteria are entered! These are the search terms on which Madaster bases the automatic matching process after a source file has been loaded. Always enter the full and identical name of the product as the search criterion. But preferably for multiple search criteria. A search criterion has a **matching type** :
- Contains
- Is equal to
- Starts with
- Ends with 
(This also helps to enter incomplete search terms as a search criterion).
