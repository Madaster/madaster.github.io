## Which roles can be assigned to users of the Madaster Platform?
Users of the Madaster Platform can be assigned three roles: administrator, manager, and reader. The following table lists the user privileges of each of the roles.

The account administrator, who is also the owner of the account, has all privileges. As an administrator, you control user access. This means you can add and delete users, as well as set user privileges.   Additionally, you can create portfolios, add buildings, materials and products to the database, export materials passports, upload files, etcetera. As an administrator, you cannot change your own user privileges.

The account administrator can grant manager privileges. As a manager, you can customize the portfolios and buildings you have been granted access to.
