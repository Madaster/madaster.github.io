## What information is shown here?
On this page, you find all products available in the Madaster database, as well as the products you have entered yourself on the platform (in the process ‘Enrich’ in a source file). In the first column ('Customer') you can see which database the product is registered in. If the product is in the Madaster database, the text 'Madaster' is displayed in the 'Customer' column. If the name of the account administrator is displayed in this column, the product has been added either by you, or by another user operating within your account. All users from your account can view this data. Users outside your account cannot. If you would like to display an overview of the products added from within your account, you can use the filter icon.

The Madaster database can be viewed by every user. You cannot modify this data. Depending on user rights, materials and products that have been added by the users themselves, can be modified.

## How can I change product data?
Click the ‘Edit product’ button for the product you would like to change.
Modify the data you would like to change. Caution: there are four tabs with data you can modify. On the ‘Materials’ tab, you can also add materials to the product directly if the product is not yet complete. The new materials you enter on this tab, will be displayed in the materials overview.
Click the ‘Save product’ button on the tab. Once you finished modifying the product you return to the products overview.

## How can I add a new product?
Adding a new product is possible as an Account owner. You can do this via the 'Administration' tab. In addition, it is possible to add a new product from the 'Enrich' tab of a source file (this can be found under the 'view details' button behind a source file).

When adding a new product, in the ’Account’ field you select for which account you want to add the new material or product. (If you are invited as an Admin to another account, new products can also be added).

In the 'Product type' field, select whether the product is a volume or a quantity product.

In the 'Product Name' field, enter the name of the product (multi-lingual: Dutch/English).

In the description you can enter more information about the product (multi-lingual: Dutch/English).

When you click on the 'Add product' button, the product is created in the database and can be found in the 'products' tab under 'Administration'. Here you can further specify the newly added product.

By clicking Edit product' next to the newly created product and cycling thru the different tabs you can enter additional information, for example for product information, circularity, product composition and search criteria.
