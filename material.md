## HOW DO I ADD A NEW MATERIAL?
There are two ways to add a new material:

- Under the tab 'Materials & Products' on the administration page you will find the button 'Add material' in the bar under the name of the tab.

- It is also possible to add a new material during the enrichment process. You can get to this screen by clicking on the arrow iconb behind a source file in the file (on g'building level). Then you can go to the second tab 'Enrich'. Here you will see an overview of all elements from your source file. If the element has not yet been linked, you can click on the 'link'-icon. A screen will appear with a heading 'Create new' and click on the 'Material' button below it. If the element is already linked, you can click on the three dots at the end of the line and then click 'Link again'. The same screen as described above will appear.

Both options take you to the screen to add a new material. Then fill in all the information about the material where fields marked with a * are mandatory fields. It is possible to enter the name and description in six languages. It is only mandatory to enter the name in the language selected within the platform. If no name and/or description is entered in the other languages, the name and/or description will be copied to the other languages. Once you have filled in all the data at the bottom of the page, press the 'Save' button. The material will then be created in your own database and can now be found in the materials and products overview.


### SEARCH CRITERIA
After this you will appear on the screen to further specify the data of the material you have just added. By going through the various tabs, you can fill in additional data. It is essential that (good) search criteria are entered! These are the search terms on which Madaster bases the automatic matching process after a source file has been loaded. Always enter the full and identical name of the material as the search criterion. But preferably enter multiple search criteria. A search criterion has a **matching type** :

- Contains
- Is equal to
- Starts with
- Ends with (This also helps to enter incomplete search terms as a search criterion).
